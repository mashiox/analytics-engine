# MBW Analytics Engine

An environment of open source application designed to collect, sample, and analyze market data.

## What does this do?

## How do I install it?

The easiest method is using docker compose with the minimal configuration. Read [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) for more information.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## What are the basic commands I need to know?
